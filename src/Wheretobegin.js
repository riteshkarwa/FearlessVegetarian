            <p>
                If you are trying to become vegetarian (aka lacto vegetarian) then you will come across lot of Indian dishes but it can be challenging if it is your first 
                time cooking Indian Food. I was lucky enough to have my mommy dearest to guide me but that could not be the case with some or most of you. Indian Grocery 
                store is the answer to all your question. All the weird sounding spices can be found in the Indian grocery store. Another thing that no one 
                tells you is that you have to be very careful with spices, (tumeric and chili powder) too much of any of those is a straight up death sentence 
                for the dish and you will have to start over. If you accidentally add to much chilli powder yougurt can help out but it depend on the dish you are making. 
                Please don't give up after first few unsucessful attempts at making a dish it gets easy after you have cooked couple of dishes. The interent is flooded with lot of vegan and vegetarian dishes but Indian food is by far the best one as it very 
                flavourful. The ingredients for Indian food is generally not available in big chain grocery store and if they are they are expensive. I would love to help you overcome
                all the obstacles if you are stuck, that is what inspired me to start this wwebsite.
