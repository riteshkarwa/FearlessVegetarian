            <h1>Where To Begin With Cooking Delicious Indian Food</h1>
            <p>
                If you are trying to become vegetarian then you will come across lot of Indian dishes but it can be challenging if it is your first 
                time cooking Indian Food. I was lucky enough to have my Mom guide me but that could not be the case with some of you. Indian Grocery 
                store is the answer to all your question. All the weird sounding spices can be found in the Indian grocery store. Another thing that no one 
                tells you is that you have to be very careful with spices, (tumeric and chili powder) too much of any of those is a straight up death sentence 
                for the dish and you willhave to start over. Please don't give up after first few unsucessful attempts at making a dish it gets easy after you 
                have cooked couple of dishes. The interent is flooded with lot of vegan and vegetarian dishes but Indian food is by far the best one as it very 
                flavourful. The ingredients for Indian food is generally not available in grocery store and if they are they are expensive. I would love to helo you 
                guys out if you are stuck, you can reach out to me with questions on Facebook.
