          In this space, I will be sharing some easy, fresh, flavorful, and healthy recipesâ€”family favorites that I love and use daily.
          Growing up in a Hindu family, being vegetarian comes naturally to me. Hopefully, for those finding it difficult to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle,
          Fearless Vegetarian is here as your friend. Remember, healthy doesn't have to mean boring. So, let's prioritize our health,
          get creative in the kitchen, and start cooking.
          If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fearlessvegetarian" className="med_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Page</a>.
          I wish I had someone to connect with or seek advice from when I started cooking.
          If you find yourself in the same situation, reach out to us. Let's support each other on this journey towards healthier and more delicious living.<br />

          <h2>Why Vegetarian Diets Are Better</h2>
          Vegetarian diets, tend to be high in fiber and low in fat and cholesterol. On average, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11434797/" className="med_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegetarians live ten years longer than meat-eaters. </a>
          Over 80% of all cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and other degenerative illnesses can be kept in check with a plant-based diet.
          Red meat and processed meats are known to cause inflammation so for people with auto immune diseases vegetarian diet can prove to be beneficial.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2>Helping The Environment</h2>
          Recent studies show that one third of all global emissions are created by the food industry and meat production is responsible for over 50 percent of this!
          Meat has a heavy carbon footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2>Excellent For Meal Prep</h2>
          Vegetarian especially Indian Food is excellent for meal prep. Time allows the flavours to blend and mature making the food tastes better the next
          day so you can make it in large quantity. The ingredients for most of the meals that I will be sharing on Fearless Vegetarian will be super cheap
          compared to eating out in restaurant. Also you can control what is added to your food especially the spice level.
